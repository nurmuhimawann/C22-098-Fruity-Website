# üåø About Fruity

**Fruity** is a website-based machine learning program which is currently under development process for the Capstone Project of ***Certified Independent Study*** of **MBKM Dicoding Cycle 3** from **Machine Learning & Front End Web Development** learning path.

<br>

<a id="3a"></a>

## üí°Background

Horticulture is an agricultural sub-sector which is important contribution to agriculture in Indonesia. In 2020, the value of horticultural exports increased by 37.75% compared to 2019. This increase was dominated by fruit commodities during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. This indicates that fruits have a high level of demand. Assessment of fruit quality is a major challenge in the agricultural sector. Controlling the external quality of fruit manually may be possible. However, it will take a long time and have implications for productivity. Based on the problems above, we propose a website-based classification system "Fruity" to help identify rotten fruit as a first step for quality control in fruit commodities.

<br>

<a id="3b"></a>

## üéØ Goal & Aim

This website aims to help everyone (especially fruit growers and fruit sellers) as an utility to help identify fresh and rotten fruits by uploading the image of the fruits. This feature is expected to increase productivity in detecting defects in agricultural fruits.

<br>


<a id="4"></a>

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

This section will explain the steps for installing and deploying Fruity to a web service with a short code. This process is divided into 3 parts, the first one introduction and prerequisites, the second is creating the Flask project itself, and the last is the hosting process on the platform as a service. Fyi, initially, we used Heroku. Sadly, since today (starting **November 28, 2022**), Heroku has eliminated all free services. We are using other alternative platforms, one of which is **Fly.io** and **Railway**. In the project, we use Railway. But, Railway has drawbacks, access is limited to 500 hours of use. Therefore, we're looking into how to set up Fly.io as a backup host.

<br>

<a id="4a"></a>


## üì¶ Built Using

Fruity is a web-based machine learning program developed by training models using the end-to-end machine learning platform, **TensorFlow**. And then, the trained model is connected to the web server using **Flask**.

<br>

<a id="4b"></a>

## üé® Prerequisite

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), one of the top machine learning and AI programming languages.
- [**Tensorflow**](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip), The core open-source library to help you develop and train ML models. in this package there is **Keras**. Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow.
- [**Flask**](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/), Flask is a web application framework written in **Python**.

<a id="4c"></a>

<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Get Started Project

This step, steps to creating Flask project and setting up in the development environment, which is running on a local server.

### üßµ Installation of the Project to Virtual Environment

To be able to push it into a stand-alone virtual environment, follow this step. If you have already done this, step to the next step.

1. Clone this repository

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/nurmuhimawann/C22-098-Fruity-Website.git
    ```

2. Install Python Virtual Environment

    ```bash
    $ virtualenv venv
    ```

3. Install All the Requirements Inside "requirements.txt"

    ```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create Flask App Environment Variables & Run Server

    ```bash
    $ env:FLASK_APP = "wsgi"

    $ flask run
    ```

5. Open URL referencing LocalHost in your browser

    üéâ Yeaay, Congrats. The web app is successfully running on the local server. If you want the application accessible on the internet, you must deploy this app to a web service platform. Let's go to the next step üòâ.

<br>

<a id="4d"></a>

##  üöÄ Deploy Machine Learning Model with Flask

### Annotation

You don't have to use both. Just choose either Fly.io or Railway.

<p align='center'>
  <img align='center' src='readme-assets/flyio.svg' width='300'/>
</p>
</summary>

<!-- Content -->

1. Install Flyctl

    On OS windows, Run the Powershell install script.

    ```bash
    $ iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
    ```

2. Login Fly.io

    If it‚Äôs your first time using Fly.io, you‚Äôll need to sign up for an account.

    ```bash
    $ flyctl auth signup
    ```

    If you already have a Fly.io account, all you need to do is sign in with flyctl. Simply run:

    ```bash
    $ flyctl auth login
    ```

3. Configure the App for Fly

    Each Fly application needs a `fly.toml` file to tell the system how we'd like to deploy it. That file can be automatically generated.

    ```bash
    $ flyctl launch
    ```

4. Deploying to Fly

    ```bash
    $ flyctl deploy
    ```

5. Viewing the Deployed App

    You can see, the application has been assigned with a DNS hostname.

    ```bash
    $ flyctl status
    ```

6. Connecting to the App

    This will open a browser on the HTTP version of the site.

    ```bash
    $ flyctl open 
    ```

    And that‚Äôs it! This is everything, now your web application accessible on the internet. Congrats üéâ

</p>
</summary>

<br>

This is the easiest way to deploy a web application to a railway because you don't need to type commands on the CLI like Fly.io.

1. Prerequisite

    You need GitHub and Railway account. If this is your first time using [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Railway](https://railway.app/), you will need to register both GitHub and Railway. If you already have a Github and Railway account, Make sure to connect your Railway account to GitHub.

2. Forking a GitHub Repository

    If you have this project in your repository, you can skip this step and proceed to the next step. But, if you don't have it yet, you can go to [GitHub](https://github.com/), navigate to the [nurmuhimawann/C22-098-Fruity-Website](https://github.com/nurmuhimawann/C22-098-Fruity-Website) repository. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Fork**.

3. Go to your railway dashboard and click on `New Project` Button.

4. Select the option `Deploy from GitHub repo`

5. Provide Railway app to access your GitHub repositories.

6. Soon, your project should be live.

    On your dashboard, you can see the application has been assigned with a DNS hostname.

    <p align='center'>
      <img align='center' src='readme-assets/dashboard-railway.png' width='100%'>
    </p>

    Every time we make changes in our repo, the app will be redeployed. And that‚Äôs it. Your project has been completely deployed on Railway and is easily available for public use! Congrats üéâ

# ‚öõ How Does the Inference Work?

1. User **uploads an image** to web application.
2. Gets the user **input of images** from Flask pages. After that, the application checks file extension to ensure that file uploaded is an image. The uploaded image is stored at `static/user_uploads` folder.
3. App extract the image's path.
4. Load the images using **tf.keras.utils.load_img(img_path, target_size=(150, 150))**. This function is applied to load image from specified path for preparation before applying image classification. The image is resized into **150x150px** resolution.
5. Because the model can't classify images directly in the initial extension. So, the image is converted first into an **array** of integers using **tf.keras.utils.img_to_array(img)**.
6. Expand the dimension of the array in input Tensor using **tf.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)**.
7. Use the model to predict the array's class using **fresh_rotten_model.predict(img_array)**. This function returns an array of model's confidence of each label. From the array, the index of maximum value is fetched using **np.argmax(prediction)**.
8. Cast the label of the prediction using **fresh_rotten_label(prediction)** to get the result. This integer value is converted into a string based on the **JSON labels** that matches the value. And the final result will display the predicted, such as ‚ÄúFresh Apples‚Äù, "Rotten Apples" etc.
